# Guide to Contributing to Hacktoberfest2025

**Welcome to the community!** This repository is designed to be your friendly starting point for open-source contributions, especially during Hacktoberfest. We are excited to have you join us!

***

## ðŸš€ How to Get Started

We focus on helping you gain confidence and skill. Every contribution is valued.

### 1. File Organization is Key

To keep this repository clean and easy for everyone to navigate, **your files must be placed in the correct, existing directory.**

| Contribution Area | Where to Place Your Files |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Algorithms / DSA** | Place new code snippets in the relevant language folder (e.g., `Python/Algorithms`). |
| **Projects / Games** | Start a new, complete project or simple game in its own clearly named folder (e.g., `Projects/TicTacToe-Game`). |
| **Documentation** | General guides or additions go in the root or a `docs/` folder. |

### 2. Focus on Quality

We prioritize quality over rushing to complete pull requests.

* Please ensure your code **works correctly** and follows the standard conventions for that language.
* Your contribution should provide clear valueâ€”avoid submitting changes that are only for style/whitespace.

## ðŸ’¡ The Submission Process: A Step-by-Step Game

Think of the process as a small quest to a successful contribution!

1.  **Find Your Challenge:** Look at the **Issues** tab. Comment on the issue you want to claim to avoid working on the same task as someone else.
2.  **The Fork & Branch:** Fork this repository and create a descriptive branch for your contribution (e.g., `add-python-sort-algorithm`).
    * *(Imagine a small GIF animation of a flag being planted on a map here)*
    * **[GIF Placeholder: Animated "Start" or "Go" button]**
3.  **Write and Commit:** Write your code, commit your changes with a clear message (e.g., `feat: Add Quick Sort implementation in Python`).
4.  **Open the Pull Request:** Open a **Pull Request (PR)** targeting the `main` branch. In the description, clearly explain what you added.
    * *(Imagine a small GIF animation of a character delivering a scroll/document here)*
    * **[GIF Placeholder: Character successfully completing a task/delivery]**
