## ü§ù Contributing - Code Quality (Optional)
### For New Contributors
Our CI runs code quality checks but **won't block your PR**. These are informational only:
- ‚úÖ Your PR will be reviewed based on functionality
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Code quality suggestions are helpful but not required
- üéØ We're gradually improving code quality over time
### Optional: Install Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
If you want to automatically format your code:
```
bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
# Install the hooks (one-time setup)
pre-commit install
# Now hooks run automatically on commit
git commit -m "your message"
```markdown
