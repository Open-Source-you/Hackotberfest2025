Problem - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Constraints
1 ≤ prices.length ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^4
